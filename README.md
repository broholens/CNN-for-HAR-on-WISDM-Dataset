# CNN-LSTM-CNN+LSTM-for-HAR-on-WISDM-Dataset

## CNN, LSTM, CNN+LSTM for human activity recongnition 

compare the three methods for human activity recongnition on WISDM dataset(smartphone dataset)

WISDM Dataset(WISDM_ar_v1.1_raw.txt) is downloaded from http://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php

WISDM Dataset includes six activities:sitting, jogging, walking, downstairs, upstaires, standing

compare the three models' performance,as it is shown as following:
